# Xpswap

**Xpswap** is a mini-replica of **Uniswap V2**, built using **Solidity**, **Foundry**, and **Next.js**. The project aims to recreate the core mechanics of Uniswap, focusing on decentralized token swapping, liquidity pools, and automated market making (AMM).

---

## 📘 **Project Status**
Currently under development — **Smart contracts are being written and tested**. The Next.js frontend and full integration with Foundry will be built after the smart contract logic is complete.
